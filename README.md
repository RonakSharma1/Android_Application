# Aim
Developed an Android application to track my calories intake during the week. The application further uses this data to predict weight gain/loss and provides suggestion to achieve the target

# Requirements
1. The user shall enter the maximum calorie intake for each day of the week (Target)
2. The user shall enter the name of the food, its calorific value and its amount consumed. The programme shall calculate the calories consumed and store the details in a SQL database
3. The user shall be able to delete the food items from the database
4. The application shall be display the food items consumed by user for each day(as stored in the database)
5. The application shall display the percentage calories consumed compared to the Target value for each day using a pie chart
6. The application shall display the the calories consumed throughout the week using a histogram
7. The user shall enter their specific body features like age, weight and height
8. Using body features and calories consumed, the application shall predict if the user is expected to gain or loose weight

# Motivation
This was a personal project developed to expand my knowledge about software engineering by solving a problem close to me. During the app development, I was transitioning to a healthier lifestyle and hence this application was developed to ease that process


# Setup/Installation
1. Install Android Studio
2. Clone the 'CalorieCount' folder
3. Open the folder using Android Studio and press 'Run' on the toolbar
Note: If an error is generated, you would have to disable the 'InstantRun' feature. Please follow this tutorial for this purpose [Disable_Instant_Run](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42781934/android-error-while-installing-apks)
